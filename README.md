## 🚀 Self-hosting conditions and warnings

You can also host your own Falbot instance in your own machine! This is only for experienced users and for users that want to help the project by contributing code.

In addition to the project's license, here are some other things that you should keep in mind:

1. I keep the source code open so people can see, learn and be inspired by how Falbot was made and, if they want to, they can help the project with features and bug fixes.

2. If you change the code, you need to follow Falbot's license and keep the changes open source. And if you want to help in Falbot's development, why not create a pull request?

3. I won't give support for selfhosted instances, you need to know how to troubleshoot the issues yourself, if you find any.

4. Don't lie saying that you "created Falbot". Please give credits to the creator!

5. Falbot's emojis aren't distributed with the source code, you will need to create and include your own assets.
